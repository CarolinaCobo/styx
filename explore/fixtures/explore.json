            "post_content": "Think of your breath as a bridge. It is a bridge between your head and your body, a bridge between your conscious and your unconscious. Your breath is a tool that allows you to take control over what you feel you can't control. Stress and anxiety are experiences that make us feel very out of control. Ranging from feeling a bit overwhelmed and unhappy to being completely unable to cope and disabled by panic. These feelings can seem to appear from nowhere and often come at the worst times, making us feel small, useless and miserable. So, our first reaction to stress is to try and 'pull ourselves together' and resolve all the problems in our head. But mentally resolving problems won't make you feel less stressed, because the stress is actually in your body. We've all had those nights, lying in bed, going over and over the worrying thoughts; it just makes you feel worse.",
